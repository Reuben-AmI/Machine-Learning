# Machine-Learning

---
This repository contains the projects that were learned in Machine Learning 4319.The purpose of this repository is to detail the process of creating different machine learning algorithms from scratch. Then implementing them on different datasets to detail how these algorithms perform.

The notebooks where created using PlutoNotebooks. Jupyter Notebooks. Pluto is a Julia programming environment designed for interactivity and quick experiments.

**The languages that were used to create the algorithms are:**

**Julia**\
**Python**

The projects created in this repository include but not limited to the following :

- Perceptron
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks
- K-Means Clustering
- Gradient Descent
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Classification Trees
- And Possibly More
